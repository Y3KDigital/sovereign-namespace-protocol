# CROWN DELEGATION POLICY

**Effective Date:** January 17, 2026
**Authority:** Y3K Governance (Crown Holder)

This policy defines the usage, delegation, and governance of the 11 Crown Letters locked as Y3K_INFRASTRUCTURE.

## 1. Crown Infrastructure Roots

The following single-letter namespaces are permanently reserved for protocol infrastructure and cannot be transferred from Y3K control:

| Crown | Designation | Purpose |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| **x** | Personal Sovereignty | The Founder's personal root namespace |
| **y** | Business Operations | Y3K business identity and operations |
| **k** | Y3K Brand | Primary brand namespace |
| **l** | Legal | Legal infrastructure, courts, and justice systems |
| **a** | AI & Agents | Artificial Intelligence orchestration root |
| **b** | Banking | Financial institutions and trust structures |
| **f** | Finance | Decentralized finance and payment rails |
| **t** | Trust | Identity, evidence, and records |
| **e** | Enforcement | Dispute resolution and arbitration |
| **r** | Registry | Namespace and contract registries |
| **c** | Compliance | Risk management and control frameworks |

## 2. Internal Usage (Tier 2 Sub-Namespaces)

Y3K retains direct control over the second-level sub-namespaces beneath these crowns to ensure semantic consistency.

**Examples:**
- `law.l` (Legal System Root)
- `bank.b` (Banking System Root)
- `finance.f` (DeFi Root)
- `agents.a` (AI Agent Registry)

These Tier 2 roots are used to issue delegations to third-party partners.

## 3. Partner Delegations (Tier 3 Sub-Namespaces)

Y3K may issue revocable delegations to qualified partners at the third level.

**Structure:** `{partner}.{functional_root}.{crown}`
- Example: `firm.law.l`
- Example: `chase.bank.b` (Hypothetical)

**Requirements for Delegation:**
1. **KYB (Know Your Business):** Verified corporate identity.
2. **Usage Agreement:** Adherence to this policy.
3. **Revocability:** Y3K retains the right to revoke delegations for policy violations.
4. **Fees:** Subject to commercial negotiation.

## 4. Revocation & Enforcement

Delegations are not property rights; they are policy-bound licenses.
- **Immediate Revocation:** For fraud, abuse, or security incidents.
- **Process:** Cryptographic revocation of the delegation certificate.

## 5. Pricing

- **Tier 2 (Internal):** Not for sale.
- **Tier 3 (Partner):** Custom enterprise pricing.
