## FAQs

### Is this an investment?

**NO.** Y3K namespaces are digital collectibles with potential utility. We make NO promises about future value, returns, or profits. Purchase only if you're interested in the technology and collectibility.

### Why no discount for friends & family?

To comply with securities regulations and ensure fairness. Discounted pricing for insiders can be seen as preferential treatment. Same price = same opportunity for everyone.

### What if I change my mind?

All sales are final. No refunds. Carefully review disclaimers before purchasing. Only buy what you can afford to lose.

### Can I sell my namespace later?

Yes, you control the cryptographic keys. You can transfer ownership anytime. Secondary market value is determined by buyers/sellers, not Y3K Digital.

### What happens if Y3K Digital shuts down?

Your namespace exists independently. You have the certificate, keys, and IPFS backup. It's self-sovereign (you own it regardless of company status).

### Is this legal?

We've structured this as digital collectibles, not securities. However, regulations vary by jurisdiction. Consult your own legal/tax advisors.

### What about taxes?

Purchases may be taxable events in your jurisdiction. We do NOT provide tax advice. Consult a CPA.

### Can I gift this to someone?

Yes, you can transfer ownership after purchase. But the original purchase must be yours (can't buy on behalf of others initially).

### What if genesis ceremony fails?

Full refunds issued if ceremony doesn't complete. Payments held in escrow until genesis success is verified.
