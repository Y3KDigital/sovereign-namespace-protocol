## Why This Phased Approach?

### Protocol First, Infrastructure Second

**This is intentional, not a limitation.**

**Comparable Launches:**
- **Bitcoin (2009)**: Protocol launched, wallets came later, exchanges much later
- **Ethereum (2015)**: Blockchain launched, developer tools built over years
- **ENS (2017)**: Registry launched, integrations added progressively

**Y3K follows the same model:**
1. **Launch**: Genesis ceremony + root issuance (January 2026)
2. **Build**: Brand infrastructure + verification (Q1-Q2 2026)
3. **Integrate**: Ecosystem adapters + partnerships (Q2-Q3 2026)

---

### Why Not Wait Until "Everything Is Ready"?

**Three reasons:**

**1. Genesis Ceremony is One-Time Event**
- Cannot be repeated
- January 16, 2026 is the creation moment
- Delay = missed genesis date

**2. Root Scarcity is Immediate**
- 1,000 roots sell out once, never return
- Early adopters get best positions (#1-100)
- Value accrues to early participants

**3. Protocol Maturity Requires Real Use**
- Developer feedback shapes infrastructure
- Brand pilot informs feature priorities
- Early adopters guide roadmap

---

## Transparency Commitment

### What We Will NOT Do

❌ **Claim features are "coming soon" without specific dates**  
❌ **Sell brand roots without disclosure of manual process**  
❌ **Promise integrations without partnership confirmations**  
❌ **Market credentials before issuance API exists**  

### What We WILL Do

✅ **Publish monthly progress updates** (development milestones)  
✅ **Maintain public roadmap** (dates adjusted if needed)  
✅ **Clear feature flags** (available / pilot / roadmap)  
✅ **Honest communication** (no vaporware promises)

## FAQs: Launch vs Roadmap

### Q: Can I buy a brand root like `.nike` today?

**A:** Not directly. Brand roots are available via **pilot application only** (manual onboarding). We verify trademark rights, issue a reservation certificate, and onboard you manually. Full automated system launches Q1 2026.

---

### Q: Can I issue `lebron.nike` credentials today?

**A:** Not yet. Sub-credential issuance requires the **credential issuance API**, which launches in **Q1 2026** (March target). Pilot participants get priority access.

---

### Q: Can third-party apps verify credentials today?

**A:** Command-line verification works now. Public REST API and SDKs launch **Q1 2026** (April target). Developers can join preview program for early access.

---

### Q: Why launch before everything is ready?

**A:** The **genesis ceremony is a one-time event** (January 16, 2026). The protocol must launch on this date. Infrastructure builds progressively, like Bitcoin (protocol first, wallets later) and Ethereum (blockchain first, developer tools over time).

---

### Q: What if I buy a root and the roadmap delays?

**A:** Your root certificate remains valid forever (cryptographically immutable). Roadmap delays don't affect root ownership or verification. Infrastructure timing doesn't change protocol finality.

---

### Q: Are pilot brand participants guaranteed priority?

**A:** Yes. Pilot participants get:
- First access to automated claim system
- Discounted claim fees (verification fee credited)
- Input on feature development
- White-glove onboarding support

---

### Q: How do I track roadmap progress?

**A:** Three ways:
1. **Monthly updates**: [newsletter signup](https://y3kmarkets.com/newsletter)
2. **Public roadmap**: [y3kdigital.com/roadmap](https://y3kdigital.com/roadmap)
3. **Developer Discord**: [discord.gg/y3kdigital](https://discord.gg/y3kdigital)
