## KEY MANAGEMENT RULES

1. Generate keys offline in air-gapped environment
2. Store keys in secure vault, NOT in repository
3. Use key paths outside repository during execution
4. After genesis: archive keys securely, remove from active systems
5. Public keys are safe to commit, private keys NEVER

## ENTROPY SECURITY

- Commit entropy_bundle.json with commit_hash BEFORE reveal
- Update with reveal_seed ONLY at genesis execution time
- DO NOT commit reveal_seed ahead of time
- After genesis: revealed entropy is public (safe to publish)

## ARTIFACT PUBLICATION

Only publish after independent verification:
- ✅ genesis_attestation.json (signed)
- ✅ manifest.json (verified integrity)
- ✅ genesis_registry.json (spot-checked scores)
- ✅ Sample certificate bundles
- ✅ Publication hashes

DO NOT publish:
- ❌ Private keys
- ❌ Partial/unverified artifacts
- ❌ Execution logs
- ❌ Backup/temp files
