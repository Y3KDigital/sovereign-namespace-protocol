# Sovereign Namespace Protocol (SNP)

**Specification Version**: v1.0  
**Status**: FINAL  
**Date**: January 2, 2026  
**Authority**: Cryptographic Proof, Not Governance

---

## Finality Statement

This specification set is **immutable**.

No amendments, upgrades, or revisions are permitted.

Any system deviating from these specifications is not SNP.

---

## What This Means

1. **No Future Versions**: There will be no SNP v1.1, v2.0, or amendments
2. **No Governance**: No DAO, voting, or parameter changes can alter these rules
3. **No Interpretation**: The specification is self-executing and unambiguous
4. **Implementation-Agnostic**: Code that conforms is SNP; code that deviates is not

---

## Verification

The canonical specification set consists of:

- CONSTITUTION.md (SHA3-256: [to be computed])
- GENESIS_SPEC.md (SHA3-256: [to be computed])
- CRYPTO_PROFILE.md (SHA3-256: [to be computed])
- NAMESPACE_OBJECT.md (SHA3-256: [to be computed])
- SOVEREIGNTY_CLASSES.md (SHA3-256: [to be computed])
- VAULT_MODEL.md (SHA3-256: [to be computed])
- STATELESS_VERIFIER.md (SHA3-256: [to be computed])

Any implementation claiming to be SNP v1.0 MUST conform to these specifications exactly.

---

## Enforcement

These specifications are enforced by:
- **Mathematics** (cryptographic proofs)
- **Genesis** (one-time ceremony)
- **Code** (reference implementations)

Not by:
- Trust
- Promises  
- Governance
- Courts

## Authority

This specification has no author with ongoing authority.

Once published, it exists independently.

The only authority is the specification itself.

**This is final. This is permanent. This is SNP v1.0.**
